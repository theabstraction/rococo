	<h1>Sexy Scripting Language - MHost and MPlatform</h1>
	
A number of powerful features are wrapped up together in MPlatform, which provides a Sexy based multi-media platform. MPlatform
is available as a DLL in the Rococo library. MHost is built upon MPlatform and allows a script to control an execution loop
and completly script a multimedia application, such as a game. A DirectX11.1 renderer provides 2D and 3D graphics to
MPlatform. Example games in Mhost include a Galaxians prototype, a defender like clone called Harrier and RPG - an example 
2D GUI widget system.
