	<h1>Sexy Scripting Language - Derivatives #2 Part 2 - Dynamic Dispatch</h1>
	
	<p>
	In Graphics User Interface programming (GUI) there are typically many kinds of events, such as Right-Mouse-Button down
	or Alt-X up. For some APIs, such as Windows, there can literally be hundreds GUI event types. This creates
	a problem for classes that handles such messages. In C++ the solution is generally to map event types to methods by
	use of a hash table or similar structure. This can be quite cumbersome when there are a lot of classes and requires
	writing code in multiple places to handle messages. Sexy uses the Objective C and SmallTalk messaging model as a 
	solution. We begin by adding <b>(attribute dispatch)</b> to an interface. Any interface that adds this attribute is called
	a dispatch interface and any class that implements it is a message handler.
	
	<pre><code>
(interface Sys.IWidget
	(attribute dispatch)
)
	</code></pre>
	
	Any class that implments Sys.IWidget exposes its methods to the dispatch interface.
	
		<pre><code>
(struct ClickArgs 
	(Vector2 mouseLocation)
)

(class BigWidget (implements Sys.IWidget)
)

(method BigWidget.OnLeftButtonUp (ClickArgs args)-> : ... )
	</code></pre>
	
	In the example above any reference to a BigWidget via Sys.IWidget can call OnLeftButtonUp using the dispatch interface.
	If an attempt is made to call a method through a dispatch interface, and the method is not implemented by the instance
	to which the interface refers the method call is ignored.
	
	<p>All dispatch methods have one input - a struct, and return no output. Since structs are passed by mutable refernce
	the single argument can use any of its fields to serve as either input our output or both. By convention dispatch method
	arguments have types with suffix Args.
