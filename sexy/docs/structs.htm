	<h1>Sexy Scripting Language - Derivatives #1 - Structs</h1>
	<p>
	<p>	Related data can be packaged together in structures, using <i>struct</i> keyword:
	<code><pre>
(struct Vector3
	(Float32 x)
	(Float32 y)
	(Float32 z)
)
	</code></pre>
	The example above creates a new type derived by stacking 3 32-bit IEEE-754 single precision numbers. The components
	are labelled x, y and z. As a shorthand, when components all have the same type they can put into the same declaration line thus:
	<code><pre>
(struct Vector3
	(Float32 x y z)
)
	</code></pre>
	Structs can also define members that are other structs themselves:
	<code><pre>
(struct Matrix3x3
	(Vector3 v1 v2 v3)
)
	</code></pre>	
	<p>
	The memory layout of Sexy primitives, structs and objects corresponds to that equivalent structures in C++ with a
	field alignment of 4 bytes.
