	<h1>Sexy Scripting Language - Raw S-Expression</h1>
	
	It is possible to store arbitrary data within a Sexy file, and use it as a data repository, something similar to an XML file.
	This is done with the apostrophe '.
	
	<p>Any compound expression with first character apostrophe is ignored by the Sexy compiler, as in the example below:
	
<pre><code>
	(' this is raw data)
</code></pre>

	In the MPlatform environment, Sexy supports a very limited pre-processor set. In fact, just one pre-processor command. This has
	the format (' #include &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; ... &lt;fileN&gt;). This command is only parsed for the main script file
	and adds all files in the include statement to the source bundle for compilation. The same technique can be used to add any
	meta data to a file for use by third-party parsers.
	
	<p>
	In addition it is possible to define an expression variable as exampled by the following syntax:
	
	<pre><code>
	(IExpression s = ' (this is raw data))
	</code></pre>
	
	As we can see <b>s</b> is a variable of type <b>Sys.Type.IExpression</b> which is initialized to an expression (this is raw data). The various methods
	of IExpression can be used to pull out the tokens. This allows you to embed arbitrary data in a program, create a reference
	to it and then process that data, which saves having to load a separate file and write a parser for it.
