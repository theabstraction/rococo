The Rococo libraries are copyright(c) 2025 Mark Anthony Taylor. All rights reserved. Email mark.anthony.taylor@gmail.com. 

Most of the libraries and modules are free and open source. You are not allowed to branch the files in the core language folders in the sexy folder
(SS/STC/SVM) as this would destroy the value of the language by creating competing language standards. Look at what happened to LISP, LUA and Java.
Not fun - don't go there.

Hyperverse is a private commercial development. The software is neither free nor open source. It has been taken off the repo for now.


Gui Retained - GR- is open source and free for use outside of commercial game engines as long as the projects it is used in take no revenue, including, but not limited to,
revenues from advertising and microtransactions. It is free for use when MHOST or MPLAT are the principle game engine / library platforms. Branching is forbidden in any case.

A release for Unreal Engine is at the beta stage, when it is released I will announce licensing terms for applications to use GR on that platform.

Licensing cost will likely be about $3000 for Unreal Engine for any single retail project.

Using GR on Unreal Engine outside of the official Rococo plugin (TBA) is strictly prohibited.

From April 2025 and onwards the scripting language is not free for use with commercial game engines. Since branching was forbidden from the inception of the language
then if you use older versions of the language in a commercial game engine you will not have the right to update the code and will be stuck with the bugs and feature limits
of deprecated builds.

A release of a scripting language host for Unreal Engine is planned for the near future. I will announce licensing terms closer to the time.
