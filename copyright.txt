Most of the libraries and modules are free and open source. You are not allowed to branch the files sin the core language folders in the sexy folder though
(SS/STC/SVM) as this would destroy the value of the language by creating competing standards. Look at what happened to LISP, LUA and Java. Not fun.
Don't go there.
