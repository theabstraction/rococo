The Rococo libraries are copyright(c) All rights reserved 2022. by me, Mark Anthony Taylor.

Most of the libraries and modules are free and open source. You are not allowed to branch the files in the core language folders in the sexy folder
(SS/STC/SVM) as this would destroy the value of the language by creating competing language standards. Look at what happened to LISP, LUA and Java.
Not fun - don't go there.

Hyperverse is a private commercial development. The software is neither free nor open source. It has been taken off the repo for now.


Gui Retained - GR- is open source and free for use outside of commercial game engines as long as the projects it is used in take no revenue, including, but not limited to,
revenues from advertising and microtransactions. It is free for use when MHOST or MPLAT are the principle game engine / library platforms. Branching is forbidden in any case.

A release for Unreal Engine is imminent, at which time I will announce licensing terms for applications to use GR on that platform.

Using GR on Unreal Engine outside of the official Rococo plugin (TBA) is strictly prohibited.

From April 2025 and onwards the scripting language is not free for use with commercial game engines. Since branching was forbidden from the inception of the language
then if you use older versions of the language in a commercial game engine you will not have the right to update the code and will be stuck with the bugs and feature limits
of deprecated builds.

A release of a scripting language host for Unreal Engine is planned for the near future. I will announce licensing terms closer to the time.

If any of the terms in this copyright is unclear or unspecified, then contact me for written clarification.
